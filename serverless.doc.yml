    description: Fetch measures according to the specified criteria. Measures
      may be filtered by location, geohash, time interval and sensor id. In case multiple conditions are set, they are
      associated using the "and" operator. I.e., it is possible to obtain all the measures of sensor x within time
      interval t, but not the measures of sensor x OR the measures in time interval t. For the latter situation,
      two calls are needed.
